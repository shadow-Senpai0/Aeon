    <summary>Build And Run the Docker Image</summary>
Make sure you still mount the app folder and installed the docker from official documentation.

- There are two methods to build and run the docker:
  1. Using official docker commands.
  2. Using docker-compose. (Recommended)

------

#### Build And Run The Docker Image Using Official Docker Commands

- Start Docker daemon (SKIP if already running, mostly you don't need to do this):

sudo dockerd
- Build Docker image:
'''
sudo docker build . -t leechx
'''
- Run the image:
'''
sudo docker run -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 leechx
'''
- To stop the running image:
sudo docker ps
```
'''
sudo docker stop id
'''
----

#### Build And Run The Docker Image Using docker-compose

**NOTE**: If you want to use ports other than 80 and 8080 for torrent file selection and rclone serve respectively, change it in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/weebzone/WZML-X/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) also.

- Install docker-compose

sudo apt install docker-compose

- Build and run Docker image or to view current running image:

sudo docker-compose up

- After editing files with nano for example (nano start.sh):

sudo docker-compose up --build

- To stop the running image:

sudo docker-compose stop

- To run the image:

sudo docker-compose start

- To get latest log from already running image (after mounting the folder):

sudo docker-compose up

- Tutorial video from Tortoolkit repo for docker-compose and checking ports

#### Docker Notes

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:

1. Set `BASE_URL_PORT` and `RCLONE_SERVE_PORT` variables to any port you want to use. Default is `80` and `8080` respectively.
2. You should stop the running image before deleting the container and you should delete the container before the image.
3. To delete the container (this will not affect on the image):

sudo docker container prune

4. To delete the images:

sudo docker image prune -a
